## About

This blog was created as part of my learning process with Astro. It showcases my progress and experiments with the Astro Starter Kit.

## Features

- **Minimal Styling**: Allows for easy and quick customization.
- **100/100 Performance**: Meets Lighthouse performance standards.
- **SEO-Friendly**: Supports canonical URLs and OpenGraph data.
- **Sitemap and RSS Feed**: Facilitates content indexing and distribution.
- **Markdown & MDX Support**: Allows for a variety of content formats.

## Project Structure

The project follows this structure:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is mapped based on the filename.

## Commands

Basic project commands include:

- `npm install`: Installs dependencies.
- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server at `localhost:4321`.
- `npm run build`: Builds the site for production in `./dist/`.
- `npm run preview`: Previews the local build before deployment.
- `npm run astro ...`: Runs Astro CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check`.
- `npm run astro -- --help`: Gets help using the Astro CLI.
